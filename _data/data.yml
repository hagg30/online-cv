career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      My primary research area focuses on anomaly detection through transfer learning and knowledge distillation in situations where datasets are scarce in computer vision. I am researching methods to create uncertainty maps based on the inherent uncertainty in the network, derived from learned normal road situations, and optimize these to extract semantically useful pixel information for driver safety. I am interested in optimizing semantic segmentation networks that emerge from probabilistic models for abnormal situations captured by front-facing cameras in vehicles.
      Additionally, I have a significant interest in metaverse content creation based on various generative models. In particular, I have been highly interested in data-driven generative models that model the entire playable game framework, including user interactions, beyond asset creation.

    info:
      - degree: PhD in Computer Science
        university: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
        time: 2019 -
        details: |
          During my doctoral research, I focused on the development and implementation of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technologies across various sectors, including energy, education, and security. My projects ranged from integrating AI for anomaly detection and explanation in South Korea's power systems, which facilitated the identification of abnormalities and enhanced system reliability, to leading the creation of a smart AI-based learning platform for English language acquisition, and developing virtual training environments for counter-terrorism with the Korean National Police Agency. These diverse applications not only highlighted the versatility of XAI in different operational contexts but also advanced the transparency and efficiency of AI systems in critical and everyday scenarios.
      - degree: MEng in Computer Science
        university: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
        time: 2016 - 2019
        details: |
          I conducted research to develop a deep learning-based language model for open-domain Korean natural language sentences. Utilizing this model, I was responsible for generating vectors for Korean sentences and calculating their similarities, thus providing an auxiliary decision-making tool for AI models. This effort was part of a larger project aimed at strengthening Korea's AI ecosystem.
      - degree: BE in Computer Science
        university: Kyungpook National University 
        time: 2012 - 2016
        details: |
          During my undergraduate studies, I demonstrated outstanding achievements across various major subjects, equipping myself with a comprehensive academic understanding and proficiency. Particularly, with a deep knowledge in computer science, I developed a strong interest and passion for graphics and computer game development. This interest led to the topic of my graduation thesis, where I presented an engaging game format by integrating cutting-edge graphic technology with original game design principles. Throughout this process, I extensively researched not only programming skills but also methods to optimize visual representation and user experience. The knowledge and experience gained during my undergraduate course provided me with the technical foundation and creative approach necessary to solve complex problems in software development.
